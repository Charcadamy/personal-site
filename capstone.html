    <h1 class = "Quicksand"> Initial Planning</h1>
    <p>I knew I wanted to make my own personal portfolio website ever since I considered a career in programming!</p>
    <p class = "Quicksand informative-text"> Initially, I planned on doing the CS50 course from Harvard. </p>
    <p class = "Quicksand informative-text"> After banging my head against the low-level memory courses, I swapped to the odin project. </p>

    <p class = "Quicksand informative-text"> This was fun but not really related to making a website... </p>
    <p class = "Quicksand informative-text"> I managed to work my way through the odin project in April.</p>

    <p class ="Quicksand informative-text"> Which lead me to building this site! </p>
    <h1 class = "Quicksand"> The Learning Process</h1>
    <p class>Inorder to bulid this website, I had to learn a couple fundamental things.</p>
    <p>First, I had to get comfortable with using a virtual machine to run linux. As a result, I also had to learn how to use bash and navigate the command line well!</p>
    <p>The second thing was Git. Essentially, it is version control software that allows people to download copies of a database of code to work on it concurrently without affecting eachother</p>
    <p>Then, I had to learn about HTML; Although people may call it a programming language, it doesn't really encode any 'logic' only the 'format' of what a website looks like.</p>
    <p>HTML's main job is to provide a structure specifically, not how the visuals look. Try deleting the 'CSS' stylesheet to see!</p>
    <p>CSS is the language that gives the website it's actual look. All the colours, fonts, and a lot of the layout is determined by it.</p>
    <p> Right click my code to inspect! Make a change and show how Git works (explain it too!) </p>
    <p>The Odin Project was very helpful, offering step by step guides on the fundamentals.</p>

    <p>If I ever got stuck, google was my best friend, but what about AI? For the project, I kept my usage of it to 0%.</p>
    <p>For the more serious, big picture, and real-life questions, I asked my mentor!</p>
    <img src="./images/mentoremail.png">
    <p>Here, I had a university question, as well as a systems design level related one.</p>
    <p>My mentor helped guide me design wise - but just the nature of programming made it redundant to ask him unless I got seriously stuck.</p>
    <p>He was a big help and I appreciate that he's been my mentor since October!</p>

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>Overall, I really enjoyed learning how to make a website! This site is far from polished, however. I'm definitely thinking of working on it over the summer!</p>
    <p>I also learned that I'm a pretty resilient and persistent dude when it comes to programming.</p>
    <p>Making a 'somewhat' polished product (I'm being very liberal with the term 'polished') has always been a big roadblock for me. I'm glad I overcame it.</p>
    <p>I definitely think I could have managed my time more effectively. Pivoting so late to work through the Odin Project meant I didn't have much time.</p>
    <p>Now I'm even more inclined to pursue web development and programming as a career - although I'd like to use my first year in university to try out a bunch of different things.</p>
